profile project
Project I did at LeWagon. It is sort of a landing page based on someone's profile. 
I chose to do it about Monica Geller because we share our first name so everything was Friends-themed. 
The colour scheme was based on Monica's apartment colour palette.
It was really good front-end practice and I had a lot of fun with it.
